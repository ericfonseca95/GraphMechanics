# GraphMechanics Repository Setup Instructions

## Automated Repository Creation Steps

This guide will help you create and upload the GraphMechanics project to GitHub.

### Option 1: Using GitHub Web Interface (Recommended)

1. **Go to GitHub**: Visit [github.com](https://github.com) and sign in
2. **Create New Repository**: Click the "+" icon → "New repository"
3. **Repository Settings**:
   - Repository name: `GraphMechanics`
   - Description: `Biomechanically-Constrained Graph Neural Networks for Human Motion Analysis`
   - Visibility: Public (recommended for open source) or Private
   - **Do NOT** initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (we have these already)

4. **Copy the repository URL** (it will be something like `https://github.com/yourusername/GraphMechanics.git`)

### Option 2: Repository Description for GitHub

**Repository Name**: `GraphMechanics`

**Description**: 
```
Biomechanically-Constrained Graph Neural Networks for Human Motion Analysis with OpenSim/OpenCap Integration
```

**Topics/Tags** (add these in GitHub settings):

- graph-neural-networks
- motion-analysis
- opensim
- opencap
- pytorch
- human-motion
- gait-analysis
- motion-capture

**README Preview**:
The repository includes a comprehensive Python package for biomechanical motion analysis using graph neural networks, with real-world OpenCap data integration, OpenSim file parsers, and physics-informed validation systems.

### Key Features to Highlight:
- ✅ Complete Python package for biomechanical analysis
- ✅ OpenSim (.osim/.mot) and TRC file parsers
- ✅ Graph neural network models with anatomical constraints  
- ✅ Real OpenCap dataset integration
- ✅ Comprehensive validation and benchmarking tools
- ✅ Jupyter notebooks with complete demonstrations
- ✅ Clinical-grade motion analysis capabilities

### Repository Stats:
- 58 files
- ~47,000 lines of code
- Multiple Jupyter notebooks with demonstrations
- Complete test suite
- Ready for biomechanical research applications

## Next Steps After Creating GitHub Repository:

1. Copy the repository URL from GitHub
2. Run the commands in `GITHUB_UPLOAD_COMMANDS.txt`
3. The entire project will be uploaded automatically!
